        ## Purpose
        This form is for starting a **public conversation** with the repository owner.

        To respect both parties' time, this repository follows the following principles:

        - **Don't ask to ask, just ask**  
          https://dontasktoask.com/
        - **No hello**  
          https://nohello.net/en/

        Please **do not post greetings only** or messages such as:
        - "Hello"
        - "Can I ask a question?"
        - "Are you available?"

        Instead, clearly state your question or request with sufficient context.

        ⚠️ All content submitted through this form is **publicly visible**.

        ## Business Days and Response Expectations (Optional)

        The following fields are **optional** and are intended only to help set expectations.
        They do **not** impose any obligation on the repository owner.

        but interpretation may vary by individual.
